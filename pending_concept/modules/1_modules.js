// Modules (ES6)

// Q. What is JavaScript Modules?
// -  In JavaScript, a module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality. It allows you to split your code into separate files, each containing its own set of variables, functions, classes, or other code elements. Modules help organize and maintain the codebase by promoting modularity, reusability, and encapsulation.
// - Modules provide a way to declare private variables and functions that are not accessible from outside the module unless explicitly exported. This enables you to control the visibility and accessibility of the code within your program.

// SIMPLE TERM
// - Module it just a file which have some code in it. We are using that code in different file. By importing that file.

// NOTE
// - ES6 Modules: The ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) specification introduced native support for modules in JavaScript. ES6 modules use the import and export keywords to define dependencies and expose functionality between modules. ES6 modules are supported in modern browsers and can also be used with bundlers like Webpack or Rollup.
