// Concept of Datatype

// Adding string with number JavaScript treat number as a string.
let variable = "str" + 1 + 2;
console.log(variable);

// JavaScript evaluate code from left to right so it will do the arithmetic operation first than treat the answer as a string.
let variable1 = 1 + 2 + "str";
console.log(variable1);
