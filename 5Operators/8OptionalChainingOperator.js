// Optional Chaining Operator

// Q. What is optional chaining operator?
// - It's like asking someone for an answer who know the answer.
// - For example in JavaScript object when we need to access it's property and method by using `?.` we are checking that actually that object has those property and method what we need.

// SYNTAX
// const object = {
//     name = "value";
// }
// object?.name;

let obj = {
  name1: "value1",
};
console.log(obj?.name1);
