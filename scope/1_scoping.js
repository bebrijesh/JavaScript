// Q. What is Scoping?
// - For example when you declare variable inside function then you can only use that variable inside the function. You can't access that variable outside the function. Same concept is for if and else statement. But when you declare variable without inside of any function or block. You can access that variable from any where.

// Type of Scoping
// 1. Global scope
// 2. Local scope
