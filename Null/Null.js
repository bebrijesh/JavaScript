// Null

// # What is Null?
// - When you declare variable and give value of null to it.
// - It means variable has no value inside it.

var name = null;
console.log(typeof name);

// NOTE:
// - Don't get confuse with undefined and null/
// - Undefined stand for value is not given yet but it will have value in near future.
// - Null means Null.
// - In JavaScript when you check the type of null it will show as object.
// - This is bug in JavaScript if they try to fix it, all the framework which are using JavaScript they all have to rewrite again.
// - For this matter it is still existing and JavaScript team doesn't fix it.
