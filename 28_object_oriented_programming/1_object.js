// Object

// Object-oriented programming (OOP): It is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It provides a way of structuring programs by representing real-world entities or concepts as objects that have data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions).

// What
// - It is collection of properties and method.

// Why
// - We need object to store data in proper way.
// - It is like creating box/ container to store the specific item inside it. So it easy to access them.

// Example
// - In JavaScript there is Object Literal {}.
// - This means we are declaring literally an object.

const object = {
  // properties
  key: "value",

  // method
  method: function (parameter) {
    console.log(parameter);
  },
};
