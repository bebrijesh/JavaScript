"use strict";

// WHAT
// - "Use strict" is a directive in JavaScript that activates strict mode, a stricter set of rules for interpreting and executing JavaScript code.

// WHY
// - It's used to catch common coding errors, enforce better coding practices, and enhance security by disallowing potentially unsafe features and behaviors.

// HOW
// - To activate strict mode, you include the string literal "use strict"; at the beginning of a script or a function. This directive tells the JavaScript engine to interpret the code that follows it in strict mode.

// PROS
// - Helps catch common coding errors by generating more errors in certain situations.
// - Enforces better coding practices by eliminating ambiguous or problematic syntax.
// - Enhances security by disallowing potentially dangerous features and behaviors.

// CONS
// - Strict mode may break existing code that relies on non-strict behavior, requiring modifications for compatibility.
// - Some developers may find strict mode too restrictive for certain use cases, leading to additional overhead in code development and maintenance.
