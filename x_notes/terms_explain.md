# Array VS Object

| Array                                       | Object                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - It is iterable.                           | - It isn't directly iterable. But you can still iterate.                                                                               |
| - It can store different type data.         | - It can store different type of data. But key must in string format.                                                                  |
| - It can store duplicate value.             | - It can store duplicate value with different key. If you add same key in object it will take the last added key and update the value. |
| - It store data in linear form.             | - It store data in `key : value` form.                                                                                                 |
| - Element can access by using index number. | - Element can't be access using index number.                                                                                          |
| - Order of element is guaranteed.           | - Order of the property isn't guaranteed.                                                                                              |
|                                             | - It doesn't have size property.                                                                                                       |

# Set VS Map

| Set                                 | Map                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - It is iterable.                   | - It is iterable.                                                     |
| - It can store different type data. | - It can store different type of data and key can be anything in map. |
| - It can't store duplicate value.   | - It can store duplicate value with different key.                    |
| - It store data in linear form.     | - It store data in `key : value` form.                                |
|                                     | - It has size property.                                               |

# Iteration

1. For Iterating Array

- for loop
- for of loop
- forEach()

2. For Iteration Object

- for in loop: use to iterate over object properties.

# Explicit VS Implicit

- Explicit: Stated clearly and directly, leaving no room for ambiguity or doubt.
- Implicit: Unstated but suggested or implied. It's something that is understood without being directly expressed.

# Inclusive VS Exclusive

- Inclusive: Think of "inclusive" as including everything. It means something is in or part of a range or group. Imagine a party invitation that says "Everyone is welcome!" - that's inclusive.

- Exclusive: On the other hand, exclusive means something is not included. It's outside of a range or group. Think of a VIP club with a sign that says "Members Only" - that's exclusive.

# Terminology

Attribute == Fields
Function == Method == Operations == Behaviors

1. Property

- In object name pair is known as property.
- JavaScript also has in-built property for example .length (NOTE: This not function/ method)

2. Attribute == Fields

- When we create a class and define variable inside it. That variable is known as Attribute.

3. Element

- When store value in array it known as element.

4. Function Definition

- It is the name of function.

5. State of the Object

- When we assign value to the properties it known as state of the object.
- We can also assign the value to the properties when we are declaring the object. This is possible because of the constructor.

# What is Passing Reference?

- Imagine a function as a recipe for a cake. The recipe itself (the function code) tells you how to make the cake (what actions to take). Now, imagine you have a note that simply says "Cake Recipe" on it. This note doesn't actually bake the cake itself (it doesn't call the function).
- Function: The actual recipe with all the instructions (the function code).
- Function Reference: The note that says "Cake Recipe" (a variable holding the function's location in memory).

# Types of Naming Convention

1. Camel Case: helloWorld
2. Pascal Case: HelloWorld
3. Snake Case: hello_world
4. Kebab Case: hello-world
5. Upper Snake Case: HELLO_WORLD
