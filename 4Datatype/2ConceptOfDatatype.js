// Concept of Datatype

// Adding string with number JavaScript treat number as a string.
let var1 = "string" + 1 + 2;
console.log(var1);

// JavaScript evaluate code from left to right so it will do the arithmetic operation first than treat the answer as a string.
let var2 = 1 + 2 + "string";
console.log(var2);
