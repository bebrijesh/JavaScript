# Inclusive VS Exclusive

- Inclusive: Think of "inclusive" as including everything. It means something is in or part of a range or group. Imagine a party invitation that says "Everyone is welcome!" - that's inclusive.

- Exclusive: On the other hand, exclusive means something is not included. It's outside of a range or group. Think of a VIP club with a sign that says "Members Only" - that's exclusive.

# What is passing reference?

- Imagine a function as a recipe for a cake. The recipe itself (the function code) tells you how to make the cake (what actions to take). Now, imagine you have a note that simply says "Cake Recipe" on it. This note doesn't actually bake the cake itself (it doesn't call the function).
- Function: The actual recipe with all the instructions (the function code).
- Function Reference: The note that says "Cake Recipe" (a variable holding the function's location in memory).
