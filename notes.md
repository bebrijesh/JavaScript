Inclusive: Think of "inclusive" as including everything. It means something is in or part of a range or group. Imagine a party invitation that says "Everyone is welcome!" - that's inclusive.

Exclusive: On the other hand, exclusive means something is not included. It's outside of a range or group. Think of a VIP club with a sign that says "Members Only" - that's exclusive.
