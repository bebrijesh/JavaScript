// Shift Method

// What
// - The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It also shifts all remaining elements one position towards the front of the array, effectively reducing the length of the array by 1.

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
myArray.shift();
console.log(myArray);
