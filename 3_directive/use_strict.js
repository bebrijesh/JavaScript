// Directive

"use strict";

// What
// - "Use strict" is a directive in JavaScript that activates strict mode, a stricter set of rules for interpreting and executing JavaScript code.

// Why
// - It's used to catch common coding errors, enforce better coding practices, and enhance security by disallowing potentially unsafe features and behaviors.

// How
// - To activate strict mode, you include the string literal "use strict"; at the beginning of a script or a function. This directive tells the JavaScript engine to interpret the code that follows it in strict mode.
